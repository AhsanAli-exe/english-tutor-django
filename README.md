## Voice Setup

The program automatically detects available voices and selects the second voice (usually male). If you want to change this:

1. Run the program once to see available voices
2. Note the voice you prefer from the list
3. The voice selection happens automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"No module named 'openai'"**
```bash
pip install openai
```

**"No module named 'whisper'"**
```bash
pip install openai-whisper
```

**TTS (Text-to-Speech) not working**
- On Windows: Make sure SAPI5 voices are installed
- On Linux/Mac: Install espeak or festival
```bash
# Linux
sudo apt install espeak espeak-data

# Mac
brew install espeak
```

**Microphone not working**
- Check microphone permissions
- Ensure microphone is not being used by other applications
- Test with other audio applications first

**API Key errors**
- Verify your Groq API key is correct
- Check if you have credits remaining (free tier has limits)
- Ensure internet connection is stable

**"Module 'torch' not found"**
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

### Performance Tips:
